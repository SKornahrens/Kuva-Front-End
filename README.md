Week long project while attending Galvanize. 
Team: Chelcie Britt, James Mendenhall, Cole Stasney Miriam Quintana, and Steve Kornahrens

Currently Instagram does not have the functionality in place for photo albums that are populated by a group of users. For instance, a group of 5 friends go on a week long ski trip together. There is no where on Instagram those users can go to easily see the photos the group took while on the ski trip. They could use a hashtag but that could easily be added to by random people outside of their friend group. Kuva is the answer to personal group albums. 

Kuva allows a user to login, create an album by setting a title and most importantly a start and stop date for the trip/event/experience. They can also invite as many people as they want to the album. Any photo posted on instagram that falls between the start and stop date will automatically populate in the album.
